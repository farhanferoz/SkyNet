SkyNet v1.2
Copyright Philip Graff, Farhan Ferox, Michael P. Hobson
Release May 2014
************************************************************************************

Installation:

SkyNet requires the CBLAS library. This is typically installed as part of BLAS, LAPACK, or ATLAS libraries.
See http://www.netlib.org/blas/ for source if needed.

In src/Makefile, modify the following variables to your system settings:
CBLASDIR = directory of BLAS installation, with libraries in $CBLASDIR/lib and headers in $CBLASDIR/include
ICC/ICXX = serial C/C++ compilers
CC/CXX = C/C++ compilers, either serial or MPI
CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS = compiler flags for includes and optimisations, etc.
  -->  Include "-DPARALLEL" for MPI compilation

Once these are set, run "make" to build the SkyNet library and binary for the training program.
"make all" will also build the CalPred and Codec programs, which can be used with trained networks.
Run either without any command-line options for the help message with instructions.
CalPred makes predictions on data with a network. Codec performs a similar function for autoencoder (half-)networks.

************************************************************************************

Data:

You need to provide 2 sets of data:
(i) Training data to be given in <input_root>train.txt
(ii) Test data to be given in <input_root>test.txt

Data files should have comma separated entries. First line should have nin (no. of inputs), second nout (no. of outputs). For classification problems, nout should be the number of classes. If there are more than one categories (e.g. colour and gender) to be predicted then second line should be nout1, nout2, ... where nout1 is the no. of classes incategory 1 & so on.

After the first two lines, rest of the file consists of data entries with inputs for a given entry on one line & outputs on the line below the inputs. The output for classification problems consists of an integer value specifying the correct class with 0 meaning the first class.

See data/sinc* and data/cdata* for examples of data for regression and classiciation networks respectively.

Input File:

See inputs/sinc.inp & inputs/cdata.inp for example input files. The entries in input file are described below:

                            define nhid multiple times with the no. of nodes required in
                            each hidden layer in order.

                            default is 1 for all hidden and 0 for output
			    e.g. for a network with 3 layers (input, hidden & output), 10 would

startstdev                  the standard deviation of the initial random weights

************************************************************************************

Running:

In setial modes:
SkyNet <input file>
e.g.
SkyNet inputs/sinc.inp

In parallel mode

mpirun -np n SkyNet <input file>
e.g.
mpirun -np n SkyNet inputs/sinc.inp

************************************************************************************

RNN:

Recurrent Neural Network has data at various time steps. Data consists of nin input & nout outputs. The data for RNN should still have nin followed by nout on the first line but the data entries should have inputs for all timesteps for a given data entry on one line followed by outputs for all timesteps for a given data entry.

Change Log:

v1.2:
  * Added version print option
  * Added more activation functions (tanh, rectified linear units, softmax, and softplus). They are selected
    with the "#activation" option. "#linear_layers" is now removed as an option.
  * Line search has been added to find the optimal distance to search in the found direction. The default distance is 1.
    Turn this on with "#line_search" option to use either the golden section search or linbcg search.
v1.1:
  * Fixed autotools build system so that CalPred and Codec aren't built with MPI when MPI is enabled.
  * CalPred and Codec now #include the other source files they rely on instead of linking
  * Added a help print option
